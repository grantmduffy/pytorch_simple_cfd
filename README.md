# pytorch_simple_cfd
Solve Navier-Stokes equations for simple invicid, incompressible fluid flows with temperature dependent body forces. 
All differential operations are implemented using pytorch 2d convolutions.

* 2d_rl_instability.py demonstrates Rayleigh-Taylor instability between a hot and cold plate driving convection.
